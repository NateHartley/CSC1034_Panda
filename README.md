CSC1034 Programming Portfolio 1
===============================

This package is built as a part of the CSC1034: Portfolio-1.
Type `python walking_panda.py` to see a 3D model of a panda in a simulated environment.
Type `python walking_panda.py --no-rotate` to disable the rotation of the camera and freely look around the environment.

This is a re-creation of the CSC1034 Portfolio panda project I created in 2020 as part of my assessment for Newcastle University.
